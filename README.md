# The Medium

this project was inspired by the oracle program in Temple OS, created by Terry
Davis. Rest in peace, Terry.

## How It Works

every word in the insipration file is checked against a dictionary site and
saved into vocab file along with 'parts of speech' information. prophecies are
constructed by reading the sentence structure file, randomly selecting a
template, and then randomly selecting words to fill in template according to
their parts of speech.
